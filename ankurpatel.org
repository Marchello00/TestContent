Free Account Audit Report
A PPC audit examines all your digital advertising networks and conducts analyses to determine how to optimize them.

Generally, it’s best to delay a PPC audit after making significant changes. You’re relying on data to tell the story of what’s happening in an account, so ideally you want to accumulate a few months of data. Significant structural ad program changes can disturb the statistics and make data analysis more difficult.
